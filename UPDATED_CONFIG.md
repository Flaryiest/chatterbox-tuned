# ✅ UPDATED CONFIGURATION - Postprocessing Disabled

## **🎯 TL;DR**

**Postprocessing has been DISABLED** because it was making things worse:
- **Without postprocessing:** 0.178 identity gain ✅
- **With postprocessing:** 0.060 identity gain ⚠️ (Δ-0.118 degradation)

---

## **📋 Current Optimal Settings**

```python
# PREPROCESSING (ENABLED - Working great!)
ENABLE_PREPROCESSING = True
PREPROCESSING_STRATEGY = "formant_shift"
GENDER_SHIFT = "female_to_male"
FORMANT_STRENGTH = 0.85

# POSTPROCESSING (DISABLED - Was causing harm)
ENABLE_POSTPROCESSING = False  # ← Changed from True
```

## **📊 Your Results Summary**

### **✅ What's Working:**

1. **PyWorld Preprocessing:**
   - Source F2: 1797 Hz → Preprocessed F2: 1391 Hz ✅
   - Successfully shifted formants DOWN by 15%

2. **CAMPPlus Encoder (Actual VC):**
   - Identity gain: **0.178** (59× better than 0.003 baseline!)
   - Target similarity: 0.682 (68%)
   - Source similarity: 0.504 (50%)

3. **Output Formants:**
   - F1: 445 Hz (close to target's 453 Hz) ✅
   - F0: 121 Hz (close to target's 111 Hz) ✅

### **❌ What Was Broken:**

**Postprocessing Results:**
- F1 formant collapsed to 117 Hz (below F0 - physically impossible!)
- CAMPPlus identity gain dropped to 0.060 (66% worse)
- Spectral transfer was over-correcting and destroying good output

## **🎧 What You Should Hear Now**

With the **preprocessed-only output** (current config):

**Expected Quality:**
- ✅ Masculine voice (not feminine or 50/50 blend)
- ✅ Lower pitch (~121 Hz vs source ~185 Hz)
- ✅ Male formant structure (F1=445 Hz in male range)
- ✅ Should sound more like Barack Obama than Taylor Swift

**If it sounds:**
- **Still too feminine** → Increase `FORMANT_STRENGTH = 0.80` (more aggressive)
- **Robotic/artifacts** → Decrease `FORMANT_STRENGTH = 0.90` (gentler)
- **Not enough like target** → Try `SPEAKER_STRENGTH = 1.2`
- **Perfect** → Success! 🎉

---

## **🔄 Next Steps**

### **Step 1: Listen to Output**
Listen to the preprocessed-only output (`/content/output_preprocessed.wav`)

### **Step 2: Evaluate Quality**
Ask yourself:
- Does it sound male? (not female or neutral)
- Does it sound like Barack Obama? (prosody, timbre)
- Are there artifacts? (glitches, robotic sound)

### **Step 3: Tune if Needed**

**If timbre still wrong:**
```python
FORMANT_STRENGTH = 0.80  # More aggressive (20% shift)
# or
PREPROCESSING_STRATEGY = "combined"  # Add neutralization
NEUTRALIZE_VOCAL_TRACT = True
```

**If model influence too weak:**
```python
SPEAKER_STRENGTH = 1.2  # Stronger target influence
FLOW_CFG_RATE = 0.8     # Stronger guidance
```

**If pitch wrong:**
```python
ENABLE_PITCH_MATCH = True  # Enable pitch matching
PITCH_TOLERANCE = 0.5
MAX_PITCH_SHIFT = 3.0
```

## **📈 Performance Metrics Explained**

### **CAMPPlus (What Matters):**
```
✅ Identity gain: 0.178
   This is EXCELLENT! (baseline was 0.003)
   
✅ Target similarity: 0.682 (68%)
✅ Source similarity: 0.504 (50%)
   Output is 18% more similar to target than source
```

### **LSTM VoiceEncoder (Ignore This):**
```
⚠️  Identity gain: 0.0001
   This encoder is saturated (0.9996 source-target similarity)
   It cannot discriminate between your speakers
   These metrics don't reflect actual VC quality
```

**Trust CAMPPlus metrics, ignore LSTM metrics!**

## **🛠️ Troubleshooting**

### **"Output still sounds like source"**

**Try these in order:**

1. **More aggressive formant shifting:**
   ```python
   FORMANT_STRENGTH = 0.80  # 20% shift instead of 15%
   ```

2. **Add source neutralization:**
   ```python
   PREPROCESSING_STRATEGY = "combined"
   NEUTRALIZE_VOCAL_TRACT = True
   ```

3. **Increase model strength:**
   ```python
   SPEAKER_STRENGTH = 1.3
   FLOW_CFG_RATE = 0.85
   ```

### **"Output sounds robotic/artifacts"**

**Try these:**

1. **Gentler formant shifting:**
   ```python
   FORMANT_STRENGTH = 0.90  # Only 10% shift
   ```

2. **Reduce model strength:**
   ```python
   SPEAKER_STRENGTH = 1.0  # Back to default
   FLOW_CFG_RATE = 0.6     # Less aggressive
   ```

### **"Pitch is wrong"**

**Enable pitch matching:**
```python
ENABLE_PITCH_MATCH = True
PITCH_TOLERANCE = 0.5
MAX_PITCH_SHIFT = 3.0
```

- [x] Postprocessing disabled (`ENABLE_POSTPROCESSING = False`)
- [ ] Listen to output and evaluate quality
- [ ] Tune parameters if needed

## **🎯 Success Criteria**

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| **CAMPPlus Identity Gain** | >0.10 | 0.178 | ✅ EXCELLENT |
| **Output Formants** | Male range | F1=445Hz | ✅ GOOD |
| **F0 Pitch** | ~110 Hz | 121 Hz | ✅ CLOSE |
| **Perceptual Quality** | Sounds like Obama | TBD | 🎧 LISTEN |

---

## **🎉 Summary**

You've achieved:
- ✅ **59× improvement** in identity gain (0.003 → 0.178)
- ✅ **Correct formant structure** (F1=445Hz in male range)
- ✅ **Proper pitch shift** (185Hz → 121Hz)
- ✅ **No artifacts** from postprocessing (because it's disabled)

**The preprocessing is working beautifully.** Now just listen to the output and tune if needed!
